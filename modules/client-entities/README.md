## About
This is a Maiden subsystem to provide commonly used objects and methods that deal with entities usually found on clients that interact with remote systems-- particularly chat systems. If you are implementing a client, you will want to subclass the various classes provided by this system and flesh them out with the required functionality. If you are implementing an agent that should stay agnostic to the client it interacts with, you should handle the events and objects presented by this system.

## How To
There's no particular "how to" for this. Read through the symbol index to see what's contained in here. What you should use and how should be fairly self-explanatory after that.
