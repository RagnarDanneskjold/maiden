## About
This agent offers a silly "medals" system, wherein users can be awarded fictitious medals for certain things.

## How To
If you have the permission to do so, you can award other users medals, or take them away again.

    ::award SomeDude "the medal medal"

Users can view their own, or someone else's medals.

    ::show medals of SomeDude

And that's it.
