## About
This agent provides all sorts of silly distractions and commands. The functionality provided by this is purely meant for entertainment value and doesn't really hold any value beyond that.

Primarily, it offers some automatic replies to certain kinds of messages that users might type. In order to get these replies, you must activate the silly module in the given channel. See [maiden-activatable](../activatable/).

The fortune command may be of particular interest. View the `fortunes.txt` for all possible fortune messages.
