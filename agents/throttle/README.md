## About
This agent provides throttling on the users. This prevents them from overloading or spamming the services provided through commands and minimises the risk of exposing the bot to lots of users. The behaviour of the throttling can be customised rather precisely.

As soon as the throttling agent is put on a core, it will automatically record the usage stats of each user and throttle their commands at appropriate times. The few commands seen in the symbol index allow the management of the throttling configuration.
