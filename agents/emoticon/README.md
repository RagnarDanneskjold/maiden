## About
This agent provides "emoticons" for text chats. Emotes are basically special sequences that are recognised by the bot and upon which the bot replies with a specific string. Very simple stuff.

## How To
Add an emote

    ::add emoticon foo bar

And invoke it.

    And so, :foo: became something else.

That should prompt the bot to reply with "bar". That's it.
